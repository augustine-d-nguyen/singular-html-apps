# singular-html-apps
When I tried to make small tools for my team, 
I realized that why we would learn something like Python, Rust, or C#, Qt, Electron ... to build a small GUI application?
Nowadays, every PC or Mac already have an app toolkit called browser.
we don't need to install something that is too heavy to our machine.
We don't need to compile to a binary for various platforms such as Windows, Mac...
Just a singular html file, which I called a singular-html-app can achieve all thing above.
